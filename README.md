# TacticalBattle

### Description #
Tactical Battle is a simple multiplayer game that can be played on a single device. 

There's a checkered board with players on it that move in an order and can either atack or defend. The game is similar to chess, in a way, except each player has only one figure. The objective is very simple: to be the last player standing.
### Launch #
To play the game, you have to download all the files from the repository and launch the Game.java file located in the /src/main folder. To do this you might want to install the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/) for java programs.
### Usage #
After choosing the number of players and their settings the game starts. 

The game is controlled by the mouse only. 
- To move, click on the tile next to you. 
- To attack, click on the player within your attack radius. 
- To mount a shield, click on yourself.
